 Hi Rasha,

Only finances up to December 2017 are still pending. Will send the situation today.

All other points are in the report I already shared with Mr Niranj.


Thanks & Regards,
El Habib Alouah.

 Dear Rasha,I informed board memebers here in Morocco and also checked with the Account Auditor and they all booked those 2 days (22 and 23 January 2018). 
 Now, we have to organise those meetings and take maximum benefit for the availibility of the board members, if they agree, 
 as we need to have :
 - A board meeting for 2016.
 - A general assembly of shareholders for 2016.
 - A board meeting for 2017-2018.
 I am working on a detailled plan to propose to the Board. I will communicate it asap.
