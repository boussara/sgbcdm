Dear Mr. Habib, 
This is in reference to our yesterday’s discussion on the captioned subject, we had agreed the following: 
- Need to have OMA contract for all the staffs working for BRS (contract will be in English & French). 
We will send you our contract for translation at your end.
- BRS will notify any new joiner to OMA HR head office prior to their joining and will get necessary approval for recruitment
- BRS will issue contract for Youssef and will send the same to head office upon your return from leave
- BRS will notify to OMA HR head office for all the BRS staffs leave report/request prior to their leave.
- BRS will make the contract addendum (annex) all the 3 senior members salary adjustment of (25,000) 
and will share the same with OMA head office prior to the salary process for the month of August 2017. 
Will expect a cooperative and positive approach from your end for the success of the company.
